# [Add Class From Clipboard - Visual Studio Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=YevhenCherkes.AddClassFromClipboard)

## Overview

This Visual Studio extension lets developers quickly create a new C# class (interface, enum, or delegate) file from the clipboard text content, and now also copy the contents of selected files to the clipboard. It's a very useful tool for pasting code from github, gists, code samples, source code generated by LLMs, or quickly copying file contents.
